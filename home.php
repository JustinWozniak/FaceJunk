<h4>Before we get into the fun stuff...I need to post some sort of lame disclaimer. Cover my ass and yours!!!<br><br>
I have PURPOSLY left this page white, so nobody can go and complain and say they couldnt read it!!!<br><br>
We only belive in one rule here:<br><br>
<h1 class="text-centerMain">RULE #1: DONT BE A DOUCHE BAG</h1><br>
<h4>I have made this page to not include ANY advertising of any kind, and I will never sell any of your data or information.<br>
<h4>In return all I ask is KEEP IT LEGAL!!!!<br>child porn nasty shit. ok?
Feel free to post a giant dick if ya like, tits and ass are welcome as well LMAO! But nothing traumatizing<br>
IT WILL NOT BE TOLERATED!!!</h4>
<h1 class="text-centerMain">Feel free to use a phoney name!</h1><br>
<h4>I actually think everybody should use a phoney name!!! Lets make this fun!!!
I do have access to the database of accounts tho...again...idiots will be banned....<br><br>
Im really hoping I dont have to turn into "Facebook Police".<br><br><br>
That being said, when your added, your only freind will be me...."Dr Gonzo"
When you first sign in you will also be given one of twenty-five random profile pictures. Feel free to change this as well.<br>
You should also change the password I gave you....all of the above can be done on the setting page!<br><br>
This entire project is going to be on-going...Im always up for ideas, and possibly somebody to help with all of this.<br>
Big plans are in the works, Im thinking an art corner, music sharing/concert corner, weekly articles and more! ALL IN GOOT TIME!!!<br>
Im still new to programming, so you may from time to time find some funky stuff going on. Feel free to contact me if you find bugs, typos or random gibberish that makes no sence!!!<br><br>
The messenger system should work fine, different then say facebook....your allowed to message anybody at anytime. Weather your friends or not.<br>
Being a friend just makes it so you can see their posts.<br><br>
Feel free to also check out the bathroom wall...Its a place you can post anonymously!<br>
Sit back and read the nonesence others have left.<br></h4>

<h4><br>Know anybody you think should have an account on StarfüKkers?<br>
StarfüKkers is invite only for now...Send me an email with their name and email....and why they should be around. We'll see what we can do!</h4>

<h1 class="text-centerMain">WARNING: THIS PAGE IS NOT OPTIMIZED IN ANYWAY</h1><br>
<h4>This means, I am not responsible for your data bill costing you 10,000$ for one month, because your burnt 40 gigs posting dumb memes on here!!!!!!<br><br>
If ya havent noticed, the background and logo change often as well...<br>
For your own safety, USE WIFI GODDAMIT!!!!<br><br>
BY READING THIS YOU AGREE TO NOT SUE STAR STAR MEDIA, OR COMPLAIN ABOUT THE GOVERMENT <br>
OR POST PICTURES OF WHAT YOU ATE FOR SUPPER LASTNIGHT!!!!!<br><br></h4>
<h1 class="text-centerMain">WE DO NOT CARE!!!!</h1><br>
<h4>Below is what each icon means on the main page.....</h4>

<h1 class="text-centerMain">--Current Bugs/Fixes--</h1><br><br><br>
<h4>Sofar I have only styled for ONE mobile phone size. So depending on your screen size, things may be alittle funky here and there.<br>
The biggest issue Im having right now is with the image crop when you upload a profile picture. It works fine, but dosnt display nicely on a mobile device.<br>
If you REALLY want a badass profile pic, go on a laptop and change it for now. IM WORKING ON IT!
Play around with it and Im sure you'll figure it out tho....</h4>
